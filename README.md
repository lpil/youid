Unless you have a specific reason otherwise, you probably either want the
random v4 or the time-based v1 version.

Currently this library only works on the Erlang target as the JavaScript target
does not yet support non-byte aligned bit arrays.

Many thanks to Gregggreg for [the original version][original] of this library.
